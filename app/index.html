                    marquees, our garden gazebos in the Premium and Deluxe lines, or our Economy steel and Economy
                    aluminium pop up gazebos. All these gazebo tents offer great UV protection of SPF 50+. For the
                    ultimate in sun protection all of our high quality PVC (Profi-line) marquees, as well as the Premium
                    steel and Professional aluminium pop up gazebos offer UV protection of SPF 80+.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    All gazebos at House of Tents are 100% waterproof. But especially in winter, a season with a lot of
                    wind and heavy rain, the gazebo frame makes all the difference. For example, heavy duty gazebos are
                    more weatherproof than wooden frames. Wooden gazebos are also waterproof, but over time, the wood
                    can rot and splinter. Steel gazebos on the other hand, are very weather-resistant while aluminium
                    gazebos provide the best protection from rust.
                    For garden gazebos that will be standing in one place over winter, we advise choosing a model with a
                    hardtop, as the heavy duty polycarbonate panels can stand up to the worst weather conditions.
                    Depending on the model, they can even withstand snow loads of 50 to 80 kg/m².
