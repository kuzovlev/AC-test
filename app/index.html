                    All gazebos at House of Tents are 100% waterproof. But especially in winter, a season with a lot of
                    wind and heavy rain, the gazebo frame makes all the difference. For example, heavy duty gazebos are
                    more weatherproof than wooden frames. Wooden gazebos are also waterproof, but over time, the wood
                    can rot and splinter. Steel gazebos on the other hand, are very weather-resistant while aluminium
                    gazebos provide the best protection from rust.
                    For garden gazebos that will be standing in one place over winter, we advise choosing a model with a
                    hardtop, as the heavy duty polycarbonate panels can stand up to the worst weather conditions.
                    Depending on the model, they can even withstand snow loads of 50 to 80 kg/m².

                        example. Thanks to the groundbar frame, the legs of your marquee cannot slip in strong winds,
                        giving

                    <p>All pop up gazebos from House of Tents have a robust frame - made of either steel or aluminium.
                        These are available with a square or hexagonal profile. If a gazebo is to be weatherproof, the
                        tarpaulin must also be 100% waterproof. The tarpaulins of our pop up gazebos are available in
                        PVC as well as in PVC-coated high-performance polyester. The special feature that ensures that
                        these tarpaulins are waterproof? All seams are thermo-sealed. The quality of the seams is
                        therefore very high and prevents water from penetrating the pop up gazebo. You will also find
                        a large range of accessories for foldable tents on our site.
                    </p>
                    <p>For an impressive appearance, an awning is particularly recommended. This not only looks very
                        professional, but also protects against rain from the side and low sun. The tarpaulin material
                        of the awning also has a UV protection rating of SPF 80.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Tip:</span> Pop up gazebos are an excellent solution for giving shelter and shade wherever
                        you need it.
                        They are easy to erect, which make them the go-to choice as an event shelter at outdoor events.
                        While they can't match the heavy duty weather resistance of other gazebo products, it's easy to
                        fold the structure up and pop a gazebo cover over the top. The cover will protect the frame and
                        canopy from the worst weather conditions.

                    <p>Garden gazebos are available at House of Tents with a tarpaulin canopy as well as with a fixed
                        roof made of polycarbonate panels. Both shelters are 100% waterproof, stable and UV-resistant.
                        However, when the cold season arrives, we recommend that you remove the tarpaulin canopy and put
                        it into storage. This is because strong temperature fluctuations can damage the polyester and,
                        in the worst case, lead to breaks in the tarpaulin material.
                        The hardtop fixed roof, can remain outside in the garden throughout the winter. All garden
                        gazebos are delivered including sidewalls. With the sides, you can close the waterproof gazebo
                        completely or leave it open. The side wall panels can be hung loosely at the leg poles, with
                        sides connecting to each other with water-resistant zips. We recommend that you close the sides
                        overnight to ensure wind can't collect underneath the gazebo canopy.

                    <p><span>Tip</span>: There's nothing better than enjoying a small get-together with friends on a
                        warm summer evening on the patio. Even better if you have a canopy over your hot tub. It can all
                        be ruined by mosquitos and midges though.
                        Side walls can be replaced with great quality mosquito nets with a fine mesh fabric from our
                        shops to keep bugs at bay. The Sunset Premium and Deluxe models have a double rail system so the
                        mosquito nets can be attached alongside the side walls.

                <p>You'll be hard pressed to find a large variety of sizes of gazebo, starting from 2x3 metre models,
                    with 3x3m gazebos being our biggest sellers. Marquees extend to a maximum size of 8x36m. For pop up
                    gazebos our product range extends to 5x5m large gazebos. Garden gazebos are available as either 3x3m
                    or 3x4m structures.</p>

                <p>The 3x3 m gazebo for example, is available at House of Tents in fifteen different colours. Pop up
                    gazebos come in the widest variety of colours ranging from white to grey to intense colours such as
                    petrol, orange or purple. For trade fairs or market stalls, plain colours such as white and grey are
                    particularly popular. Garden gazebos feature classic tones that complement the outdoor environment
                    such as stone and loft grey. Marquees meanwhile come in white or dark green. A decorative striped
                    pattern is also possible with blue, grey, green or red stripes combining with white.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Yes! The sides of all of our gazebos and marquees, just like the canopies themselves, are completely
                    waterproof. Seams are welded with a waterproofing plastic sheet that ensures that no water will
                    enter the shelter from the sides. The side panels of the marquee gazebos, for example, are made of
                    high quality PVC and are 100% waterproof. You will also find gable sides and side panels with
                    built-in zip doors in our range of accessories.</p>
